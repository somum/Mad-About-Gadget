        <p style="color:#666675; background-color:white;px;margin-left:70px; margin-top:0px; padding:30px; border-radius:10px;margin-right:300px;"> While he previously believed the iPhone 8 would arrive in stores later than the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, KGI Securities analyst (and famed Apple rumor-monger) Ming-Chi Kuo has changed his mind. In a new investor note he shared today, Kuo claims all three models will be announced at the same time at an event in September.

That's also the month during which the trio should become available to buy, but the iPhone 8 will be in short supply at the beginning, with only 2-4 million units coming out by the end of September. Production of the handset will only pick up in the fourth quarter of 2017, but tight supply may persist until Q1 2018.</p>

        <p style="color:#666675; background-color:white;px;margin-left:70px; margin-top:0px; padding:30px; border-radius:10px;margin-right:300px;"> The floodgates have opened now that the iPhone 8 is in mass production. It didn’t take long to get what has to be the first clear photos of the upcoming bezel-less flagship, both front and back!

Speaking of the back, there’s no fingerprint here. None on the front either. There’s no photos of the sides, but it’s probably a “no” there as well. That leaves the facial recognition in charge of Apple Pay.</p>

        <p style="color:#666675; background-color:white;px;margin-left:70px; margin-top:0px; padding:30px; border-radius:10px;margin-right:300px;"> We’re still frowning at the chunky bezels of the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2, but seeing them with the clarity afforded by CAD-based renders still made us do a double take. At least we’re getting stereo speakers on the front, right?
        So far we’ve only seen the Quite Black version leak out. Very Silver and Really Blue are a safe bet, those are the three colors of the original Pixel). Of course, the Red Nexus 5 was pretty hot, here’s what that might look like (with a white or black front).</p>
